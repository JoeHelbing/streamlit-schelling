# Dependencies

- Works with ```Python 3.7``` 
- You'll need the following libraries: ```Numpy```, ```Matplotlib``` and ```Streamlit```
- I recommend using [Anaconda's Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Anaconda has ```Numpy``` and ```Matplotlib``` installed.
- You'll need to install ```Streamlit``` using the following command ```pip install streamlit```
